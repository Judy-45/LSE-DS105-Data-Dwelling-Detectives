Through a comprehensive questionnaire survey, we have gathered insights from numerous students, enabling us to assign different weights to four important factors: crime rate, convenience, distance to pharmacies, transportation, and enjoyment. These weights have been determined based on the preferences and opinions of the student community, ensuring that our scoring system reflects their priorities.

<h2 id="data">Data collection</h2>

<p></p>

<h3 id="Data sources">Data sources</h3>

<p>In order to achieve our goal on helping students to find student accommodations in London, with the factors influencing choosing student accommodation considered, we choose Google places APT, UK crime rates API and Four-square API as our data sources. Google maps API could help finding distance between accommodation and certain places (Universities, station etc.). gives us location of over 78 accommodations information of Chapter, Unite students, Urbanest, IQ and Scape. And the UK crime rate provide the crime rate data from 2019 to 2022 which helps accessing the safety level of certain accommodations. Moreover, the Foursquare API have the information of surrounding shops like supermarkets, pharmacies, pub etc., helping us evaluate the convenience level of accommodation. </p>




<h3 id="Using API">Using API</h3>




<p>When using the Google map API, the latitude and longitude data of accommodations are collected, by pointing a place, then expanding the scope, we get the name of the site with the same keywords within and outside its scope. Using the crime rate API, there are different crime types including violent crime, weapon crime thefts and drugs. And in the Foursquare API, the diversity of surrounding shops is include which is a factor of assessing accommodationsâ€™ convenience level. (Picture needed)

<p>Before getting all over these data scores combined, there are data cleaning problems worked out.




</p>

<p>



Initially, the method of calculating the distance was to match the address field of the obtained result with the latitude and longitude of the student dormitory. However, the results could not match actual situation. For example, when using this method to get a dormitory It takes 32 minutes to go to the supermarket, but if we try to search it with Google map, we find that it only takes one minute. To deal with it, we change the mode parameter in its API, which is changed from driving to walking by default. Also, to increase the accuracy of the destination, we separately changed the address from the result as the search word and changed it to use the place ID of Google map as the search.

<h2 id="Scoring system">Scoring system</h2>

<p>We utilized two questionnaires to determine the weighting of different indicators in the ratings. Our first questionnaire consisted of five items: crime rate, rental prices, transport, accessibility, and diversity. Participants were asked to rank these five items in order of importance. A total of 55 volunteer participants completed the questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire provided us with a preliminary understanding of the weighting between the different options based on the collected data. However, due to the absence of a specific scale for evaluating the importance of the options and the limited number of participants, we questioned the scientific validity and objectivity of the questionnaire.</p>

<p>Consequently, we revised and improved the questionnaire. In our second questionnaire, we included an additional question regarding the gender and nationality of the participant. This was done to determine whether the participant belonged to our target sample, specifically international students in London. In order to address the lack of quantitative data, we implemented a rating scale. Participants were asked to rate the importance of each option on a scale from 0 to 100. By doing so, we obtained an average "importance score" for each item. The ratio of the mean scores for the different options was then calculated to determine the degree of influence of each indicator on the final rating.</p><p>However, it is important to note certain aspects of this questionnaire. Firstly, our options may not encompass all the thoughts and perspectives of the participants. Thus, the results may be biased if a participant selects an option that does not truly reflect their opinion. Additionally, since the participants complete the questionnaire in an uncontrolled environment, there may be extraneous variables that could affect the results. For instance, participants may experience reduced attention spans due to fatigue effect, which can potentially impact the outcomes. Nonetheless, as a self-report technique, the questionnaire provides a convenient means of understanding the participants' thoughts. Moreover, the use of quantitative data enables scientific calculations without any human bias.</p><p>Overall, these improvements aim to enhance the validity and reliability of the questionnaire in determining the weighting of indicators for the final ratings.</p>
